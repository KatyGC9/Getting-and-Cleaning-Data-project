Install and load packages dplyr and data.table

The following variables are related to data acquired from smartphone accelerometers provided to subjects who underwent several activities. Variables such as acceleration, 
gyroscopic forces, and gravity were tracked then used in the analysis. 

The following URL will allow the user to download a compressed folder containing several files: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

The files are as follows: 
features_info.txt: an overview of the features of this dataset
features.txt: a list of all the features
activity_labels.txt: labels that will link the activities to classes
X_train.txt: data from training observations
y_train.txt: labels of data from training observations
subject_train.txt: data on each subject(n=30) in this analysis at the training phase
X_test.txt: data from test observations
y_test.txt: labels of data from test observations
subject_test.txt: data on each subject(n=30) in this analysis at the test phase

The file run_analysis.R will extract these files from the provided URL, read them from the working directory and do the following functions:
1. Merge the training and test datasets into a single data set
2. Extract the means and standard deviations from this merged data set
3. Use descriptive names to relabel the activities in the merged data set
4. Assign the appropriate labels to each variable
5. Create an independent, tidy data set with the average for each variable for each subject and for each activity
